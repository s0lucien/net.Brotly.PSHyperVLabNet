HyperV Network settings for VM lab using PowerShell and Vagrant

This project automates the setup of a multi-VM configuration and enables connecting to the VMs on host-only networks using static IP addresses. The MAC addresses are generated by using a hash function (to guarantee they will not be re-generated when the VMs and network stack is redeployed), and OpenDHCPServer is used to assign static IP addresses to the machines

The SHElevate task is used to bypass Windows UAC because commands in the HyperV PowerShell package require Administrator privileges. All output is written to the `shell` folder allowing of debugging of code inside the scheduled task
